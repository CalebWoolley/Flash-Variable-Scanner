# Flash Variable Scanner - ActionScript 1-2
A utility for variable scanning and editing in flash movies utilizing ActionScript 1 and 2.

This is a tool I made one or two years back and it's largely uncommented but the code should be largely self-explanatory.  I originally scanned for and found the ActionScript variables using Flare (http://www.nowrap.de/flare.html) but I later developed my own scanning method which is what this code utilizes.  If you find any references that may have been left behind regarding flare you now know why.  Furthermore, this code uses some flash dependencies that may be considered outdated now, so watch out for that.  Other than that, this is a fantastic utility if I may say so myself, and it's very fun to mess around with!
